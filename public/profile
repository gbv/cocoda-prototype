# Cocoda API

The API provides access to terminologies, concepts, mappings, and concept
ocurrences. The default content type is *Cocoda Resource* defined as a JSON
object with MIME type `application/vnd.cocoda+json`.

    Accept: application/vnd.cocoda+json

The API is designed as Hypermedia API, so clients SHOULD NOT assume a fixed URL
structure but discover links included in API responses. In particular, linked
Cocoda Resources can be distributed on different hosts. Some links are given as
URI templates with form-style query variables as defined in RFC 6570.

## Cocoda Resources

The following Cocoda Resource types can be distinguished:

* Provider
* Terminology Registry
* Terminology
* Concept
* Mapping Service
* Mapping
* Ocurrence (?)

A Cocoda Resource is a JSON object that comprises any of the following keys:

provider
  : title and services
version
  : ...
concepts
  : an array of concept descriptions
terminologies
  : ...
mappings
  : ...
ocurrences
  : ...

### Cocoda Provider Description

A Cocoda Provider contains links to Cocoda services.

### Cocoda Terminology Registry Description

A Cocoda Terminology Registry contains links to Cocoda Terminologies.

### Cocoda Concept Description

A concept description is a JSON object with any of the following keys:

notation
  : Unique notation, gtiven as string. This may be empty for some authority 
    files and mandatory for others. Corresponds to `skos:notation`.

prefLabel
  : Set of preferred labels, each uniquely mapped from a language. In some 
    terminologies these labels are unique while other terminologies require 
    a notation to uniquely refer to a concept. Correspond to `skos:prefLabel`.

uri
  : URI for use of concepts in SKOS/RDF.

url
  : URL to get or modify the concept as Cocoda Resource

ancestors
  : List of all broader transitive concepts. Roughly corresponds to
    `skos:broaderTransitive`. Sorted ??

narrower
  : List of narrower/child concepts, each given as ???.
    Corresponds to `skos:narrower`

broader
  : Corresponds to `skos:broader`

notes
  : Array of notes, each given as string. Corresponds to `skos:note`.

More properties, such as `alias`, may be added later.

### Cocoda Terminology Description

A terminology description is a JSON object with any of the following keys:

prefLabel
  : Set of human-readable titles of the terminology, each uniquely mapped from
    a language. Correspond to `skos:prefLabel`.

uri
  : An URI for uniquely identifying the terminology (optional).

topConcepts
  : corresponds to `skos:hasTopConcept` (TODO)

### Cocoda Mapping Description

A mapping description is a JSON object to be specified.

sourceConcept
  : URI(s) or Concept description(s).

targetConcept
  : URI(s) or Concept description(s).

sourceTerminology
  : URI or Terminology description.

targetTerminology
  : URI or Terminology description.

relevance
  : ...

An RDF triple with an [SKOS mapping property](http://www.w3.org/TR/skos-reference/#mapping)
can be derived from a Cocoda mapping.
